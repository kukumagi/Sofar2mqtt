Make sure you load the correct type firmware on your module!

The ESP8266 firmware is for the older module which has the ESP-12F chip. The ESP32-C3 firmware is for the newer model.

Visualy the newer board is different as the antenna trace line on the chip is black where on the older model the trace line is copper colored. Also, the newer model has a BOOT button which the older model doesn't have. They both do have the RESET button.
